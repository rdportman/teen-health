One of the limitations of using the Add Health data set was that we were unable to have access to the 
geospatial data for the schools that were used to create the network graphs. Thus, to add a geospatial
component to the project, and provide a visualization of adolescents  throughout the United States we 
used census data from the American FactFinder, U.S. Census Bureau to map out the population of Americans 
aged 5-15 and 16-20.  Each map is broken up by race: White, Black, and Other. 

Each map consists of four layers to include age groups broken down by gender. Thus, each map contains 
a layer for males aged 5-15, males aged 16-20, females aged 5-15, and females aged 16-20. While the 
age of adolescence is defined as 10-19 by the National Institute of Health, we were bound by the age 
categories that were provided in the census data.

Each map is broken down into quantiles to remain consistent throughout each map, and allow for 
comparison.
